## What it is ?

-  This is a tutorial to dimulate a protein-ligand system using molecular dynamics with 
   Gromacs.

-  Reference to the original tutorial is given below.

## Why this tutorial is written ?

- I hane noticed that the original tutorial is too length and that makes hard to read 
  each and every detail and so does not help much.

- The original tutotial also misses many important steps in between and so the chains of
  steps to reach the last step is broken.

## What I am presensing ?

-  I am giving here :
 . A set of scripts 
 . Explanations
 . Reference
